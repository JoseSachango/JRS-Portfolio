                    <p> Hi! My name is Jose Sachango. I'm a Houston based software developer with experience building front-end applications. I'm also a chemical engineer by training, which gives me the added advantage of being able to apply both numerical and analytical methods to solve a wider range of technical problems in the field of software development.</p>
                    <p>My background has allowed me to be adaptable and creative. It's also given me a breadth of understanding in a variety of fields. for instance, some of the projects I've worked on include: writing VBA scripts to automate data tracking for drilling and completion operations; designing a polyethylene petrochemical processes using software like ASPEN plus; working in laboratory environments running experiments on gas chromatographs and distillation columns; I've even spent time managing after school STEM programs for fourth and fifth grade boys.</p>
                    <p>All of these projects had their own unique challenges that required me to draw from of variety of resource and come up with unique solutions; that's what I love to do. If you'd let me, I'd be happy to assess your problem and come up with a solution that works for you.</p>
